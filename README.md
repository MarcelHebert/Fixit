Program Description. :   Fixit.exe

This program will extract the text in the Windows Clipboard and alter it so that every word starts with uppercase.
This program was written to help fix the format of names in Family trees. 

To start, use Ctrl-C to copy a name to the clipboard.
Now you can open Fixit.exe, and a Popup Window will appear at the top left corner of the screen.
If you have not copied any text to the clipboard or if it contains an image, you will get a message in red that says "No Text In Clipboard"
You can then copy a name into the clipboard and click the Refresh button.
The name or text will appear in black below the Refresh Button.

Click on the "-> Fix it! <-" button, to convert the text to its proper case format.
The text will be updated to confirm it looks like what you want.
The proper case text will also be updated to the clipboard.
You can now paste or use Ctrl-V to paste the new text in place.

The Popup Window can be moved and resized, and it will always stay on top.
You can continue to copy names and fix them, just click the refresh button to get the new clipboard text.
